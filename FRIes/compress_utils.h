 Parameters

 p: non-integer number to be rounded

 Returns
 -------
 integer result

/* Identify the greatest-magnitude elements of a vector to be preserved
 in a compression
 
 Parameters
 ----------
 values: vector of elements (can be + or -); not modified in this subroutine
 srt_idx: an array of indices that will be used to build the heap, must already
    contain integers from 0 to count - 1 in any order
 keep_idx: upon return, contains 1's at each position of values that should be
    preserved exactly. all elements should be zeroed before calling
 count: number of elements in values array
 n_samp: pointer to desired number of nonzero elements after compression;
    upon return, points to remaining number available for systematic resampling
 global_norm: upon return, contains the norm of the whole vector, including
    preserved elements
 
 Returns
 -------
 sum of magnitudes of elements that are not preserved exactly

/* Sum a variable across all processors and store the sum in the global ptr
 
 Parameters
 ----------
 local: local value to be summed
 global: pointer to where result should be stored
 my_rank: rank of calling process
 n_procs: total number of processors to sum over

/* Initialize the parameters needed to perform systematic sampling on a vector of weights
 
 Parameters
 ----------
 norms: array of one-norms of the portion of the vector stored on each processor
 rn: pointer to a random number on [0,1). Upon return, will be set to the position of the random sampler (the "X") within this portion of the vector.
 n_samp: desired number of elements to select in systematic sampling

/*
 Identify elements of a vector to preserve in a systematic FRI compression scheme.
 Vector elements are subdivided into sub-weights.
 
 Parameters
 ----------
 values: vector on which to perform compression. Elements must be positive.
 n_div: number of uniform intervals into which vector elements are divided. If =0,
    vector is divided nonuniformly at this position
 n_sub: length of 2nd dimension of sub_wts and keep_idx arrays
 sub_wts: 2-d array of sub-weights for vector elements divided nonuniformly;
            each nonzero row must sum to 1
 keep_idx: 2-d array that, upon return, contains 1's at all positions to be
            preserved exactly. Relevant indices should be zeroed before calling.
 count: length of values array
 n_samp: pointer to desired number of nonzero elements after compression;
    upon return, points to remaining number available for systematic resampling
 wt_remain: array that, upon return, contains the remaining weight to be sampled
    at each position
 
 Returns
 -------
 sum of magnitudes of elements that are not preserved exactly

 keep_exact: array indicating which elements should be preserved exactly; upon
             return, 1's indicate elements that should be removed from solution
