\section run_overview Overview

The FRIES_bin directory contains source code for several different methods within the FCI-FRI/FCIQMC framework as applied to different types of systems.

\section run_input Input Files

\subsection run_input_molec Molecular Systems

Executables that perform calculations on molecular systems (fciqmc_mol.c, frimulti_mol.c, frisys_mol.c) use the output from a Hartree-Fock calculation to calculate Hamiltonian matrix elements. The ` hf_path` input argument specifies the path to the directory that contains these files. The HF orbitals must be ordered the same in the **eris.txt**, **hcore.txt**, and **symm.txt** files. These files must be named and formatted as follows:

- **eris.txt**: Contains the two-electron integrals \f$ \langle i j || a b \rangle \f$, where \f$ i \f$, \f$ j \f$, \f$ a \f$, and \f$ b \f$ denote orbitals. The \f$ M^4 \f$ integrals are stored in .csv format ordered by the \f$ i \f$, \f$ j \f$, \f$ a \f$, and \f$ b \f$ indices, where \f$ b \f$ is the least significant index and \f$ i \f$ is the most significant.

- **hcore.txt**: Contains the one-electron integrals \f$ \langle i | \hat{h} | a \rangle \f$, stored in .csv format analogously to the two-electron integrals

- **symm.txt**: Contains the irrep of each orbital in the HF basis, one on each line, encoded as described <a href="https://sunqm.github.io/pyscf/symm.html#symm" target="_blank">here</a>.

- **sys_params.txt**: Contains parameters describing the system. See examples for formatting
  - `n_elec`: The total number of electrons in the system
  - `n_frozen`: Number of core electrons to freeze in the calculation. The orbitals with the lowest indices, as determined by the ordering in the above files, will be frozen.
  - `eps`: The value of \f$ \varepsilon \f$ (the imaginary time step) to use to evolve the solution vector during the calculation
  - `hf_energy`: The HF electronic energy of the system, in Hartrees (optional, but useful for accelerating convergence)

\subsection run_input_lattice Lattice Systems

Code for running calculations on the Hubbard model (fciqmc_hh.c and frisys_hh.c) use the parameters in the file at the path specified by the `params_path` input argument. See the examples for an example format of this file. The parameters are as follows:

- `n_elec`: The total number of electrons in the system
- `lat_len`: The number of lattice sites along one dimension
- `n_dim`: The number of dimensions in the lattice
- `eps`: The value of \f$ \varepsilon \f$ (the imaginary time step) to use to evolve the solution vector during the calculation
- `U`: The on-site repulsion energy, in units of \f$ t \f$ (the kinetic energy hoping term)
- `hf_energy`: The HF electronic energy of the system, in Hartrees (optional, but useful for accelerating convergence)
